In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may experience imposter syndrome as they navigate the complex technical aspects and challenges of artificial intelligence. Despite the prevalence of imposter syndrome in various fields, including AI, it is important to recognize that struggling with certain concepts or finding aspects of AI challenging is a common experience shared by many individuals, even those who are accomplished in the field.\n",
